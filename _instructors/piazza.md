[piazza.com](https://piazza.com) is a commerical, for-profit enterprise that offers a product for classroom discussion forums.

There is no monetary cost to using Piazza, although there is a "cost" in terms of having to manage "yet another tool".

On the plus side, students seem to like having a Piazza forum in their classes, and many  instructors have found that if the tool is used
well, it has many benefits.

# How to set up Piazza for a UCSB course

Setting up a course in Piazza is straightforward.

1. Create an account at piazza.com
2. Follow the instructions to set up a course.

The thing where you might need guidance if you are new is how to get the students into Piazza.

Two options:
* Have the students  "add themselves".   This is less work for you, but you can't be sure that all students are actually in the forum.
* Add them yourself by uploading a file containing all of their emails.  This is not very much work, and it has the benefit that you can see, at a glance, how many of the students registered for your course have actually bothered to activate their accounts.

One fun fact: once a student activates their account once, from then on, if an instructor adds them to a course with the same email, they 
get activated immediately.    So, if you are teaching courses later in the curriculum, with high probability, a large fraction of your students 
will become active immediately after you upload their emails.

You can get a CSV file of all the students in your course from Egrades [https://egrades.sa.ucsb.edu/](https://egrades.sa.ucsb.edu/).
