If you are an instructor of record for a UCSB course, you have access to the eGrades system via your UCSBNetID.

You can access the system at this link: <https://egrades.sa.ucsb.edu/>

Through that interface, you can
* Browse your course roster for current and past classes, by lecture and discussion section (name and perm number only) 
* Download your class rosters for current and past courses (more on format below)
* At the end of the quarter, this is where you enter or upload final course grades for your students
* You can also update grades after they are first entered, if you find that there was a clerical 
    error in entering a previous grade.   
    (Before changing a grade for any other reason, note the 
    following [UCSB policy about grade changes](https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/AcademicPoliciesProcedures/GradeChanges.aspx)
