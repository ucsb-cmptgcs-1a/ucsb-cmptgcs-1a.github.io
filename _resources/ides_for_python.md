Python comes with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called IDLE.  The name IDLE is a tribute to Eric Idle, 
who was an original member of the Monty Python comedy act that Python is named for&mdash;his name contains three of the letters in IDE.

Some folks like IDLE, and others don't.   Here are some alternatives to using IDLE:

* Using plain text editors such as vim, emacs, Sublime Text, along with using the Python interpreter at the command line.
* [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide) the Scientific Python Development Environment.
* [PyCharm Edu](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/) A free and open-source tool for Python Educaton from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com), a for-profit 
   company that makes IntelliJ, RubyMine, CLion and other professional IDEs.
