If you are a UCSB students, faculty member or staff member (i.e. anyone with a UCSBNetID, or access to computer on campus),
you can get free access to a zillion great Computing related textbooks, at the link below:

From off-campus, you can either use one of the

you can use this link (if it works, which it sometimes does):
