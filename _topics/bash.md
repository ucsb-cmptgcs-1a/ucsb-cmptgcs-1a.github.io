When you type in commands at the Unix command line, you are using one on several command line *shell* programs.

A *shell* is simply the word that we use for a program that accepts command line input for the Unix operating system.

The most commonly used shell in 2016 is the *bash* shell.    

Bash was first developed by a programmer named Brian Fox, who happens to live in Santa Barbara.

# Shell Scripting

Bash also provides control structures such as `if`, `while`, `for`, etc., 
as well as the ability to define functions&mdash;and thus can  be used for programming.   The power of bash
programming is that the basic Unix commands to copy, move, delete and rename files, as well as listing and creating
directories (`cp`,`mv`,`rm`,`mkdir`,`rmdir`, `ls` etc.) can be put into these "bash programs" as commands.

Programs that are written with bash are called *shell scripts* or *bash scripts*.
